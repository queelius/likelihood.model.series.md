\title{Constructs a likelihood model for \code{wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3}.}
\usage{
wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3(
  shapes = NULL,
  scales = NULL,
  lifetime = "t",
  indicator = "delta",
  candset = "x"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapes}{shape parameters for Weibull component lifetimes (optional)}

\item{scales}{scale parameters for Weibull component lifetimes (optional)}

\item{lifetime}{column name for system lifetime, defaults to \code{"t"}}

\item{indicator}{column name for right-censoring indicator, defaults to \code{"delta"}.
TRUE/1 = exact failure time, FALSE/0 = right-censored.
For backwards compatibility, if this column is not present in the data,
censoring is inferred from empty candidate sets (all FALSE).}

\item{candset}{column prefix for candidate set indicators, defaults to \code{"x"}}
}
\value{
likelihood model object with class
\code{c("wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3", "series_md", "likelihood_model")}

\description{
Likelihood model for Weibull series systems with masked component cause
of failure with candidate sets that satisfy conditions C1, C2, and C3.
}
\details{
This model satisfies the concept of a \code{likelihood_model} in the
\code{likelihood.model} package by providing the following methods:

(1) \code{loglik.wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3}
(2) \code{score.wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3}
(3) \code{hess_loglik.wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3}

The Weibull series system has 2m parameters: (shape_1, scale_1, ..., shape_m, scale_m).

In this likelihood model, masked component data approximately satisfies:

C1: \verb{Pr\{K[i] in C[i]\} = 1}
C2: \verb{Pr\{C[i]=c[i] | K[i]=j, T[i]=t[i]\} = Pr\{C[i]=c[i] | K[i]=j', T[i]=t[i]\}}
for any \verb{j, j' in c[i]}.
C3: masking probabilities are independent of \code{theta}

\examples{
# Create model and fit to data using generic dispatch
model <- wei_series_md_c1_c2_c3()
# solver <- fit(model)
# theta: (shape1, scale1, shape2, scale2, ...)
# mle <- solver(data, par = c(1, 1000, 1, 1000, 1, 1000))
