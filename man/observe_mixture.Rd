\title{Mixture of observation schemes}
\usage{
observe_mixture(..., weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{observation functors (created by \code{observe_*} functions)}

\item{weights}{mixing probabilities (numeric vector). If NULL, uniform
weights are used. Weights are normalized to sum to 1.}
}
\value{
A function with signature \code{function(t_true)} returning a list
from one of the constituent schemes, selected randomly according to
\code{weights}.
}
\description{
Creates an observation functor that randomly selects from a set of
observation schemes for each observation. This models heterogeneous
monitoring environments where different units are observed differently.
}
\examples{
obs <- observe_mixture(
  observe_right_censor(tau = 100),
  observe_left_censor(tau = 50),
  weights = c(0.7, 0.3)
)
set.seed(42)
obs(30)  # randomly selects one of the two schemes
}
