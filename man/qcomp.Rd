\title{Quantile function for a component with custom hazard/survival}
\usage{
qcomp(
  p,
  haz = NULL,
  surv,
  theta,
  t_lower = .Machine$double.eps,
  t_upper = .Machine$double.xmax^0.5,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{probability (quantile level), must be in (0, 1)}

\item{haz}{hazard function h(t, theta, ...) (currently unused but kept for API consistency)}

\item{surv}{survival function S(t, theta, ...)}

\item{theta}{parameter vector passed to surv}

\item{t_lower}{lower bound for search interval}

\item{t_upper}{upper bound for search interval (sqrt to avoid overflow in survival calculations)}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to surv}
}
\value{
time t such that S(t) = p
}
\description{
Finds the time t such that S(t) = p using root finding.
The survival function S(t) is assumed to be monotonically decreasing
from S(0) = 1 to S(inf) = 0.
